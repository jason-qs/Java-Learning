# Java-Learning

I do solemnly swear that I will support my learning initiative against all enemies, bugs and syntax errors; that I will fulfill the requirements of the course; that I take this obligation freely, without any mental reservation or purpose of evasion; and that I will well and faithfully commit early and often to this project on which I am about to enter.
Goals
I will learn Java by the end of Week 12 through completing a course and building a hackathon project from scratch
I will utilize the following course to learn Java: https://app.pluralsight.com/paths/skills/java-language-fundamentals
I will begin the course no later than Day 2 of Week 10
I will stay well-hydrated and take regular bathroom breaks
I commit to finish the course work by the end of Day 2 of Week 11
I will begin working on a hackathon project using Java on Day 3 of Week 11
I will have a completed MVP by Day 5 of Week 11
I will ask my peers for help when I get stuck, instead of breaking my keyboard

Expectations
If I’m stuck on a problem for more than 20 minutes, then I will get up and take a walk for a couple minutes to clear my head

If I see a cute puppy, then I may go pet it (but for no more than 5 minutes)
